# EV-Range-Rimulation
Numerical simulation project modelling electric vehicle range along real-world routes using trapezoidal integration, Newton–Raphson root-finding, and explicit Euler ODE solvers. Includes interpolation of route data, energy consumption modelling, convergence analysis, and dynamic route simulation.
